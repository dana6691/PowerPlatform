## Get started with model-driven apps in Power Apps
### Canvas apps
- app maker has total control over the app layout

### Model-driven app design
- an approach that focuses on quickly adding components to your apps. These components include dashboards, forms, views, and charts. With little or no code, you can make apps that are simple or complex.
- layout is determined by components you add

### 3 design phases
1. Model your business data
- determine what data the app will need and how that data will relate to other data. Metadata means data about data and it defines the structure of the data stored in Microsoft Dataverse.
3. Defined your business processes
4. Build the app

### Components
1. Data components
  - Table/Column/Relationship/Choice column (option set designer)
3. User interface components
  - App/Site map/Form/View
5. Logic
  - Business process flow: An online process that walks users through a standard business process. 
  - Workflow: automate business processes without a user interface.
  - Actions: type of process that lets you manually invoke actions, including custom actions, directly from a workflow.
  - Business rule: Used to apply rule or recommendation logic to a form, such as to set column requirements, hide columns, or validate data
  - Power Automate Flow: a cloud-based service that lets you create automated workflows between apps and services to get notifications, sync files, collect data, and more.
7. Visualizations
  - Chart/Dashboard/Embedded Power Bi
9. Advanced model-driven apps
  - Solution Explorer is used to make advanced model-driven apps
  - must select Solution > Switch to classic to access the classic solution explorer
