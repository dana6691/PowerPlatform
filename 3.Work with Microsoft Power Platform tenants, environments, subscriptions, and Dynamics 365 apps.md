## Manage Microsoft Power Platform deployments
- how you can protect your organization's data.
- how you can monitor and manage what users are doing with these services. 
- centrally deploy solutions for your entire organization. and orchestrate updates and fix an error

### Establishing Center of Excellence (CoE)
investing in and nurturing the organic growth the Power Platform can provide while maintaining governance and control.

### Roles and responsibilities
1. Low-code strategy team: represents the key decision makers and ensures the Microsoft Power Platform strategy is aligned with organizational goals. Botton up/ Top down
2. Microsoft Power Platform admin team: establishing an environment strategy, setting up data loss prevention (DLP) policies, and managing users, capacity, and licensing. They also make data available to makers through connectors, integration, or migration.
3. Microsoft Power Platform nurture team: organizes app-in-a-day events and hackathons, provides mentorship to makers and ensures new makers get off to a good start

### Automation and reusable components
- automating tasks, such as archiving unused resources, identifying highly used resources to provide more formal support, and approving environment and license requests from end users
- set up application lifecycle management using the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps, support architecture reviews with makers, and share common templates and reusable components

### Delivery Models
- how you'll be delivering solutions to the organization.
1. Centralized: create central teams of product owners who own the low-code delivery of departmental solutions. include members who specialize in specific parts. effective way to drive change across your organization
2. Decentralized: create multiple teams across the organization that are close to the day-to-day running of various teams. Each team can run autonomously. still need centralized governanc
3. Matrix:  mix the best of decentralized and centralized. You have a centralized team of trained and certified Microsoft Power Platform specialists. You'll have leaders of change, design, delivery, and architecture, in addition to specialized trainers to train local teams across the organization
4. BizDevOps: Rapid app development can only happen at the speed that operations such as IT can support the apps created

### Plan your deployment
1. Administrative roles - Dynamics 365 admin/Microsoft Power Platform admin
2. Adding an environment to your subscription
  - Environments are containers that administrators can use to manage apps, flows, connections, and other assets, along with permissions to allow organization members to use the resources.
  - Each environment is created under an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant, and its resources can only be accessed by users within that tenant.
  - Environment is also bound to a geographic location
  - Role:
      - Environment Admin
      - Environment Maker
   - Types:
      - Sandbox environments (non-production): isolated from production environments, a Sandbox environment is the place to safely develop and test application changes with low risk.
      - Production environments: *backup can be created. need to switch to Sanbox to proceed restoring from the backup, and then switch to Production again.
      - Microsoft Dataverse for Teams
    
### Secure deployments
- Establishing a DLP strategy:  Data loss prevention (DLP) strategy. DLP policies act as guardrails designed to help prevent users from unintentionally exposing organizational data and to protect information security in the tenant. rules for which connectors are enabled for each environment,
- Connector classification
    - Business: given resource can use one or more connectors from a business group
    - Non-Business: given resource can use one or more connectors from a non-business group
    - Blocked: No Power App or Power Automate resource can use
-  shared user and team productivity environments
    - Create a policy spanning all environments except selected ones. Create a policy spanning all environments except selected ones
-  production (business unit and project) environments:
    - Exclude those environments from shared user and team productivity policies.
    - Work with the business unit and project to establish
    - Environment admins of those environments can use environment policies to categorize custom connectors

### Determine storage requirements
Full Power Apps and Power Automate capabilities are licensed on a standalone basis.  As an administrator, you aren't required to have a standalone 
- Storage capacity
    - Microsoft Dataverse capacity (database, file, log, and add-ons)
    - Power Apps per-user plan: 10 GB of Dataverse database, 20 GB of Dataverse file, and 2 GB of Dataverse log
    - The tenant subscriptions include by default 10-GB database storage
    - no charge at the rate of 5 GB for every 20 full users (10-GB default database storage + 5-GB more database storage)
    - free storage per tenant = 30 TB.
    - To create a database, there must be at least 1 GB of Dataverse database capacity remaining.
    - Add on: increments of 1 GB per Additional Storage Add-on license
 
### Manage authentication
three main identity models in Microsoft 365 when you set up and manage user accounts:
1. Cloud identity: Manage your user accounts in Microsoft 365 only.
   - Use when you have no other on-premises user directory. You have a complex on-premises directory
2. Synchronized identity:  Synchronize on-premises directory objects with Microsoft 365 and manage your users on-premises. User can have the same password, but needs to sign in.
3. Federated identity: Synchronize on-premises directory objects with Microsoft 365 and manage your users on-premises. User can have the same password, single Sign-On.
   - Types of seamless single Sign-on
       - Password hash sync (PHS):simplest way.synchronize your on-premises Active Directory user account objects with Microsoft 365 and manage your users on-premises. When passwords are changed or reset on-premises, the new password hashes are synchronized to Azure AD
       - Pass-through authentication (PTA):  Allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and Microsoft 365 resources and applications using their on-premises account and password.
       - single Sign-on(Azure AD Seamless SSO)  automatically signs users in when they are on their corporate devices connected to your corporate network. 
    You have a complex on-premises directory

### Connect and authenticate to data sources
- Connecting to Microsoft Dataverse
    - Power Apps canvas and model-driven apps no need connectors
    - Canvas apps store consent in the Power Apps Resource Provider (RP).
    - Power Automate authenticates using an API Hub
- Connecting to non-Dataverse data sources: Azure API Management (APIM) connector.

- Types
  - Explicit authentication: means the app user's credentials are used to access the data source.
  - Implicit authentication: means the credentials the app maker provided when creating the connection are used.

## Administer Microsoft Power Platform subscriptions
Power Platform admin center links to Azure Active Directory/Microsoft 365 Admin Center/Power BI

### Manage users with Microsoft 365 admin center
can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create user accounts for every user who needs access to apps created
1. User (with no admin center access) 
2. Admin center access

#### Add users
- Home page > Add a user tabbed > Basics (name, username, domain) > Product licenses > Optional settings (assign any administrative access)
- Can add multiple users at once up to 249 users on the Basics
#### Manage existing users
#### Microsoft 365 admin roles
- Global admin - Accesses all administrative features in the Microsoft 365 suite of services in your plan, including Skype for Business. By default, the person who signs up to buy Microsoft 365 becomes a global admin. Global admins are the only admins who can assign other admin roles. Only global admins can manage the accounts of other global admins. (2 to 4 personnel per organization is a good rule-of-thumb), but for certain Power Platform developers you want to assign them the Power Platform admin role.
- Power Platform admin - Accesses and manages multiple environments and perform admin functions in the Power Platform because they have the System Administrator role.
- Billing admin - Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.
- User admin - Resets passwords, monitors service health, adds and deletes user accounts, manages support tickets, and adds and removes members from Microsoft 365 groups. The user management admin can't change or add a global admin. 
- Dynamics 365 admin - Use this role to assign users to manage Dynamics 365 at the tenant level. A person with this role can't perform (such as manage user accounts, manage subscriptions, or access settings)
* it is possibble to manage user with PowerShell

### Manage your environment with Power Platform 365 admin center
- Use Administration mode: only users with *System Administrator or System Customizer security* roles can sign in to that environment (sandbox, production, trials) when administration mode is enabled and background operations are disabled. System Customizers need to sign in to the environment directly through the URL. 
- Copy an environment: to copy data between environments. Only those with the System Administrator role can sign in and manage the copy environment. The background operations are disabled
  - Everything: User acceptance testing/Upgrade testing/Preview in production/Training
  - Customizations and schemas only: Iterative team development/proof of concept
- Back up and restore environments
   - **System backup**: All except trial environments are backed up. backups occur continuously via Microsoft Azure SQL Database technology. need to restore an environment to the same region. audit logs aren't deleted.  target environment must be in the same geographical region with source environment.  target environment must be in the same geographical region 
   - **Manual backup**: created for you when Microsoft updates your environment. back up production and sandbox environments.can't back up the default environment. aren't limited in the number of manual backups. don't count against your storage limits. need to restore an environment to the same region
