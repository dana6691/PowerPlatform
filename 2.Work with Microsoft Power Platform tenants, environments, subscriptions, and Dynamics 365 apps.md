## Manage Microsoft Power Platform deployments
- how you can protect your organization's data.
- how you can monitor and manage what users are doing with these services. 
- centrally deploy solutions for your entire organization. and orchestrate updates and fix an error

### Establishing Center of Excellence (CoE)
investing in and nurturing the organic growth the Power Platform can provide while maintaining governance and control.

### Roles and responsibilities
1. Low-code strategy team: represents the key decision makers and ensures the Microsoft Power Platform strategy is aligned with organizational goals. Botton up/ Top down
2. Microsoft Power Platform admin team: establishing an environment strategy, setting up data loss prevention (DLP) policies, and managing users, capacity, and licensing. They also make data available to makers through connectors, integration, or migration.
3. Microsoft Power Platform nurture team: organizes app-in-a-day events and hackathons, provides mentorship to makers and ensures new makers get off to a good start

### Automation and reusable components
- automating tasks, such as archiving unused resources, identifying highly used resources to provide more formal support, and approving environment and license requests from end users
- set up application lifecycle management using the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps, support architecture reviews with makers, and share common templates and reusable components

### Delivery Models
- how you'll be delivering solutions to the organization.
1. Centralized: create central teams of product owners who own the low-code delivery of departmental solutions. include members who specialize in specific parts. effective way to drive change across your organization
2. Decentralized: create multiple teams across the organization that are close to the day-to-day running of various teams. Each team can run autonomously. still need centralized governanc
3. Matrix:  mix the best of decentralized and centralized. You have a centralized team of trained and certified Microsoft Power Platform specialists. You'll have leaders of change, design, delivery, and architecture, in addition to specialized trainers to train local teams across the organization
4. BizDevOps: Rapid app development can only happen at the speed that operations such as IT can support the apps created

### Plan your deployment
1. Administrative roles - Dynamics 365 admin/Microsoft Power Platform admin
2. Adding an environment to your subscription
  - Environments are containers that administrators can use to manage apps, flows, connections, and other assets, along with permissions to allow organization members to use the resources.
  - Each environment is created under an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant, and its resources can only be accessed by users within that tenant.
  - Environment is also bound to a geographic location
  - Role:
      - Environment Admin
      - Environment Maker
   - Types:
      - Sandbox environments (non-production): isolated from production environments, a Sandbox environment is the place to safely develop and test application changes with low risk.
      - Production environments: *backup can be created. need to switch to Sanbox to proceed restoring from the backup, and then switch to Production again.
      - Microsoft Dataverse for Teams
    
### Secure deployments
- Establishing a DLP strategy:  Data loss prevention (DLP) strategy. DLP policies act as guardrails designed to help prevent users from unintentionally exposing organizational data and to protect information security in the tenant. rules for which connectors are enabled for each environment,
- Connector classification
    - Business: given resource can use one or more connectors from a business group
    - Non-Business: given resource can use one or more connectors from a non-business group
    - Blocked: No Power App or Power Automate resource can use
-  shared user and team productivity environments
    - Create a policy spanning all environments except selected ones. Create a policy spanning all environments except selected ones
-  production (business unit and project) environments:
    - Exclude those environments from shared user and team productivity policies.
    - Work with the business unit and project to establish
    - Environment admins of those environments can use environment policies to categorize custom connectors

### Determine storage requirements
Full Power Apps and Power Automate capabilities are licensed on a standalone basis.  As an administrator, you aren't required to have a standalone 
- Storage capacity
    - Microsoft Dataverse capacity (database, file, log, and add-ons)
    - Power Apps per-user plan: 10 GB of Dataverse database, 20 GB of Dataverse file, and 2 GB of Dataverse log
    - The tenant subscriptions include by default 10-GB database storage
    - no charge at the rate of 5 GB for every 20 full users (10-GB default database storage + 5-GB more database storage)
    - free storage per tenant = 30 TB.
    - To create a database, there must be at least 1 GB of Dataverse database capacity remaining.
    - Add on: increments of 1 GB per Additional Storage Add-on license
