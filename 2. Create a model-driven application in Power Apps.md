## Get started with model-driven apps in Power Apps
### Canvas apps
- app maker has total control over the app layout

### Model-driven app design
an approach that focuses on quickly adding components (dashboards, forms, views, and charts) to your apps. With little or no code, you can make apps that are simple or complex. Unlike the app maker in canvas apps, layout is determined by components you add.

### 3 design phases
1. Model your business data
    -  uses *metadata-driven architecture* so that designers can customize apps without writing code. determine what data the app will need and how that data will relate to other data. Metadata means data about data and it defines the structure of the data stored in Microsoft Dataverse.
2. Defined your business processes - Defining and enforcing consistent business processes 
3. Build the app

### Components
1. Data components
    - Table/Column/Relationship/Choice column (option set designer)
        - Table: standard table or customize a non-system standard table (production) or create a custom table from scratch
        - Column: property associated with a table. (text, number, date and time, currency, or lookup)
        - Choice column: a set of predetermined options. each has a number value and label. choices or multi-select choices    
2. User interface components
    - App/Site map/Form/View
        - APP: determine the app fundamentals; components, properties, client type, and URL
        - Site map: navigation for your app
        - Form: data-entry columns.
        - View: defined how a list of records for a table appears in your app. ex) defined column is shown, width, sort, and default filter.    
3. Logic
    - Business process flow: An online process that walks users through a standard business process. 
    - Workflow: automate business processes that don't require any user interaction
    - Actions: lets you manually invoke actions, including custom actions, directly from a workflow.
    - Business rule: Used to apply rule or recommendation logic to a form, such as to set column requirements, hide columns, or validate data
    - Power Automate Flow: a cloud-based service that lets you create automated workflows between apps and services to get notifications, sync files, collect data, and more.
4. Visualizations
    - Chart/Dashboard/Embedded Power BI
        - Chart: a single visualzation, can be displayed within a view/form/dashboard
        - Dashboard: one or more visualizations provide overview of actionable data
        - Embedded Powewr BI: add tiles and dashboards to the app. close-based, BI insight    
5. Advanced model-driven apps
    - Solution Explorer is used to make advanced model-driven apps
    - must select Solution > Switch to classic to access the classic solution explorer
