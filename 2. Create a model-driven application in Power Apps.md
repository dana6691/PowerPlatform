# Get started with model-driven apps in Power Apps
### Canvas apps
- app maker has total control over the app layout

## Model-driven app design
an approach that focuses on quickly adding components (dashboards, forms, views, and charts) to your apps. With little or no code, you can make apps that are simple or complex. Unlike the app maker in canvas apps, layout is determined by components you add.

### 3 design phases
1. Model your business data
    -  uses *metadata-driven architecture* so that designers can customize apps without writing code. determine what data the app will need and how that data will relate to other data. Metadata means data about data and it defines the structure of the data stored in Microsoft Dataverse.
2. Defined your business processes - Defining and enforcing consistent business processes 
3. Build the app

### Components
1. Data components
    - Table/Column/Relationship/Choice column (option set designer)
        - Table: standard table or customize a non-system standard table (production) or create a custom table from scratch
        - Column: property associated with a table. (text, number, date and time, currency, or lookup)
        - Choice column: a set of predetermined options. each has a number value and label. choices or multi-select choices    
2. User interface components
    - App/Site map/Form/View
        - APP: determine the app fundamentals; components, properties, client type, and URL
        - Site map: navigation for your app
        - Form: data-entry columns.
        - View: defined how a list of records for a table appears in your app. ex) defined column is shown, width, sort, and default filter.    
3. Logic
    - Business process flow: An online process that walks users through a standard business process. 
    - Workflow: automate business processes that don't require any user interaction
    - Actions: lets you manually invoke actions, including custom actions, directly from a workflow.
    - Business rule: Used to apply rule or recommendation logic to a form, such as to set column requirements, hide columns, or validate data
    - Power Automate Flow: a cloud-based service that lets you create automated workflows between apps and services to get notifications, sync files, collect data, and more.
4. Visualizations
    - Chart/Dashboard/Embedded Power BI
        - Chart: a single visualzation, can be displayed within a view/form/dashboard
        - Dashboard: one or more visualizations provide overview of actionable data
        - Embedded Powewr BI: add tiles and dashboards to the app. close-based, BI insight    
5. Advanced model-driven apps
    - **Solution Explorer** is used to make advanced model-driven apps
    - must select Solution > Switch to classic to access the classic solution explorer

## Design-driven app design
The primary design goal is to get your Microsoft Dataverse data model in order. Model-driven apps are created using the *App Designer*. You will choose tables/dashboards/business process flow/forms/other components.
- Business requirements: security, accessibility, data, and design needs
    - security: hierarchy security, row-level security, government regulations or authentication/authorization requirements, internet disconnction (Offline Mode), using iOS or Android 
- Data Model: view metadata two ways; Dataverse or Play mode, column types, determine how users enter and view (dropdowns, currency symbol). *changing datatype, you need to delete the column and recreate it. define in the App Designer What Forms, Views, Charts, and Dashboards. also control the navigation options. 
- Business Logic
    - business Rules on your Dataverse tables: define behaviors at the data layer. ex) default value, required column
    - build Business Process Flows: guide users ex) visuals based on the status of the data
- Output: implement Dashboards with custom filters and visual graphics.

## Sharing Model-driven app design
Microsoft Power Apps uses role-based security for sharing. must have the *Environment Admin* or *System Admin* role. All app users must be assigned to one or more predefined or custom security roles.

  - Create or set up a security role
       - The Power Apps environment includes predefined security roles. 1) Expand an existing predefined security role  2) Expand an existing predefined security role
   - Create a custom security role
       - Power Apps > ... > Share > Manage security role > New
   - Create a custom security role
   - 
### Business process flow
Business process flows provide a guide for people to get work done. to define a set of steps for people to follow to take them to a desired outcome. reduce the need for training because new users donâ€™t have to focus on which table they should be using.up to 10 active business process flows per table
